# Drumline Server Rules

*Our goal is to ensure that everyone on the Drumline Server™ can have a great experience. Admins reserve the right to use their best judgment when enforcing these rules. If you need to report an issue, please contact an admin.*

---

## 1. No Cheating (Hacking / Exploits)
- **Fair Play:** Do not use any clients, mods, or resource packs that give you an unfair advantage.
- **Server Performance:** Absolutely no lag machines or exploits intended to crash or degrade server performance.
- **Report:** Please report any suspicious behavior or hacking attempts to an admin immediately.

## 2. Keep It Family-Friendly
- **Chat:** Use language that is appropriate for all ages—no offensive or inappropriate remarks.
- **Builds:** Avoid creating or naming builds (including items or mobs) with inappropriate content.
- **Overall Atmosphere:** Maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for all members.

## 3. Respect Others (No Stealing & Only Friendly Griefing)
- **Bullying:** Do not target or bully other players with the intent of upsetting them.
- **Property:** Do not steal items or blocks from another player without explicit permission. This includes items in chests, shops, or public builds.
- **Griefing:** While friendly competition is allowed, please respect the time and effort others have put into their work. Avoid excessive or destructive griefing that disrupts the creative efforts of others.
- **Pranks:** If you decide to prank someone, ensure it’s lighthearted, only involve friends, and does not ruin someone’s experience.

## 4. Communication & Suggestions
- **Speak Up:** If you have questions or suggestions to improve the server, please reach out to an admin.
- **Feedback:** We’re always open to feedback—help us keep the Drumline Server a positive and fun place for everyone.
